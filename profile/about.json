Love to particpate in hackathons and won the JPMC Code for Good 2021 edition. \n\n\n I am also into competetive programming and have secured a global rank of 23 and AIR 5 out of 20k+ pariticpants in contests. Apart from pariticpating in online contest, I am also improving the CP culture at my college as the lead of the Codechef IGDTUW Chapter.

If not learning new things about tech, can be found learning how to solve new cubes.",
